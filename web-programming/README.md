## General Course Requirements:

The final mark is computed by using the following formula:

**FinalMark = 40% LabsMark + 60% FinalExamMark**

The final exam will be a quiz on [Moodle](https://moodle.cs.ubbcluj.ro/).

---

Labs tasks are assigned to students through the **[imPULSE](https://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/~forest/impulse/)** portal. 
The lab mark is the average of the marks the student gets on the labs resolved during the semester. A student gets the 
mark 1 for a missing lab (i.e. a lab not shown to the professor). Each week past the deadline will decrease with 1 point 
the maximum mark a student can get for that lab. In one physical lab class, the student is allowed to present exactly 1 
lab task (maximum 2 tasks if the lab professor allows it). A student should go to the lab activity scheduled for the 
group the student belongs to. The student can also go to a lab class with another group (not his own) if the lab professor
for that group allows it. Students who take this course again can choose the lab activity that best fits their own schedule 
but still, the lab professor must agree to it. If you are having problems choosing a lab class, tell this immediately  
(in the beginning of the semester) to Ioan Badarinza. Any organizational problems you are having with this course or 
the lab (e.g. the student's imPULSE account does not work), must be reported immediately to Ioan Badarinza - it's the 
student's responsability to do this.

---

In order to successfully pass this course, each of the above marks must be at least 5. In addition, the student must 
present at least 5 labs to the professor in order to enter the final exam and one of these must be a server-side lab 
(PHP+Ajax or JSP/Servlet).

---

Labs (practical work) can not be recovered in the re-examination session (i.e. 'restanta') - one can not do in 1 or 2
hours what he/she was supposed to do a whole semester (i.e. 12/14 weeks). 



## Particular Requirements for Mathematics and Computer Science (Mate-Info)
Course Requirements:
The presence at the labs is mandatory. Students are required to **be present to at least 5 labs**.

A student who does not have at least 5 attendances at the labs and a lab mark at least 5 will not be able to enter the re-examination session.

**Exception**: students who take this course again (i.e. 3rd year students) are not required to have any number of attendances
at the lab, but they still need to show lab works so that their final average lab grade is at least 5.

### Labs information

#### Labs Deadlines

- html - Lab 1
- css1 - Lab 2
- css2 - Lab 3
- js - Lab 4
- jquery - Lab 5
- ajax+php - Lab 6

A lab not shown to the lab professor will be graded with 1.

#### Labs weights
The method used for computing the final lab grade : At the end of the semester, the following weights are used to
compute the final lab grade:

- html - 10%
- css1 - 10%
- css2 - 10%
- js - 10%
- jquery - 10%
- ajax+php - 50%

A lab not shown to the lab professor will be graded with 1.


## Particular Requirements for Information Engineering (Ingineria Informatiei)
Course Requirements:
The presence at the labs is mandatory. Students are required to **be present to at least 12 labs**.

A student who does not have at least 12 attendances
at the labs and a lab mark at least 5 will not be able to enter the re-examination session.

**Exception**: students who take this course again (i.e. 3rd year students) are not required to have any number of attendances
at the lab, but they still need to show lab works so that their final average lab grade is at least 5.
